# An-Automated-Approach-to-Obesity-Classification-Using-IBM-Watson-AutoAI
This project uses IBM Watson AutoAI to classify individuals as underweight, normal, overweight, or obese based on health data. AutoAI automates the entire machine learning process—data preprocessing, algorithm selection, and model optimization—saving time and improving accuracy. The system is developed on IBM Cloud using Watson Studio and deployed as a web API for real-time predictions. The best-performing model (Pipeline 4) efficiently classifies obesity levels. This approach offers a fast, scalable, and reliable solution for healthcare analytics, with future potential for integration with wearable devices and personalized health monitoring.
